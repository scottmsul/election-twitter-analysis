# Analysis of the Democratic Primaries
This is an analysis of the Democratic primaries.
At the time, the goal was to predict the California Democratic primaries before they happened.
The predictions were made by downloading tweets in states with past primaries, and looking at the ratios between twitter supporters and actual votes for each candidate.
A detailed writeup of the analysis and methods can be found in `docs/election_analysis.pdf`.

This was a side project I did because I thought it would be interesting.
Unfortunately the actual results in California fell well outside the predictions, but I haven't gotten around to writing a follow-up.
