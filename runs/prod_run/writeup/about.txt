Hi,

My name is Scott Sullivan, and I wrote this paper.
I'm a graduate student in physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
I've been on break at my parents house for a few weeks, so naturally I had some free time.
I was curious to see if Twitter data can statistically predict the upcoming primaries, so I put that time to good use and did this little analysis.
Most of the work was done in Python, using MongoDB to store all the results.
I didn't realize when I started downloading tweets that MongoDB only stores ~1 GB for 32-bit OS (otherwise I would have downloaded more data).
Currently there's about 10 hours of tweets from the middle of last week, although originally I wanted 1 or 2 days.

As I'm typing this, it's about 1:00 in the morning the day before the major primaries.
All my main predictions can be accessed in the attached csv file.
I did the best I can with the knowledge I have, mostly undergrad tricks with some intuition and googling.
This wasn't intended to be published in a research journal, I did this mainly for fun.

For questions, concerns, comments, etc. I can be reached at scott dot sullivan at colorado dot edu.

Best,
Scott
